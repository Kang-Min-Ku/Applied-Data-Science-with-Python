## Why write discussion opinion here?
I wrote answer to discussion, but I deleted it because I wanted to edit my answer. After delete my answer, I couldn't wrote anything to discussion. It seems problem of the page(I don't know reason why. Maybe people made discussion page didn't consider that situation). So, I save my answer in this file.

# <Q>
In writing on what makes a visualization great, Alberto Cairo wrote that "An enlightening graphic is a consequence of paying attention to the previous four qualities. A graphic that is truthful, functional, beautiful, and insightful has the potential of being enlightening as well. But there's something else to consider at this point: the topic of the visualization. Choosing topics ethically and wisely - casting light over relevant issues - matters a lot." (The Truthful Art, p. 60)

Do you believe that the process by which we evaluate the quality of information visualizations is amoral? That is, that the rules, heuristics, and intuitions we apply to the creation of a "good information visualization" are separate from the domain and social/ethical responsibilities we might hold as practicing data scientists?

If the topic is "Are data or graphics amoral itself?", then my answer is "Data visualization should be enlightening"

For answering this topic we should talk about the question 'Who is moral?'. Data is not moral itself. morality is only applied to human not data.

furthermore, I think fully objective data visualization is not possible. It contains his or her perspective, knowledge and so on. Morality can be one standard for composing data. 

However, the top priority is **"Data should be fair"**. Being morality doesn't mean "Seeing only one side". Data must be truthful. It should provide all informations even if they makes him or her uncomfortable.
